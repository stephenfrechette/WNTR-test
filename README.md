water distribution networks.  The software includes capability to:

* Generate water network models
* Modify network structure and operations
* Add disruptive events including pipe leaks
* Add response/repair strategies
* Simulate pressure driven demand and demand driven hydraulics
* Simulate water quality 
* Evaluate resilience 
* Visualize results
